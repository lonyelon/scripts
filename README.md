# Lonyelon's hacker scripts

This is a collection of scripts I made for my own personal use,
some may be useful to someone,
most will probably not.

Sadly,
I can't include all scripts I've made since some contain personal information.
Maybe I'll have to make a script to remove it when uploading hehe.

## Dependencies

Most script's only require a POSIX-compatible shell and the GNU basic utilities (awk, sed... Etc).
