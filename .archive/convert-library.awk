# This was a temporary script I made to convert my library csv file to yaml. The
# purpose of this file was to keep track of the books I read, own or want.
#
# The CSV file's format is the following:
# Title,Author,Tags,Buy date,Format,Read start,Read end,Notes?
#
# Since the file has been converted, there is no longer a point in having this
# script outside the archive directory, so there it goes.
